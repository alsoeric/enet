Title: US Healthcare Economics - Innovating our way out of a Crisis<br>

<p>Description: The US spends more than any other country in the developed world on healthcare on both a per capita (US$ PPP) and percentage of GDP basis.
Despite that high spending and incredible technical sophistication, US healthcare ranks near the bottom of the developed world on many health care quality indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality.
The pressure to drive costs down drives the incentive to innovate up for the Med-Tech Entrepreneur.
</p><p>
This discussion is essential for MedTech developers
to understand the economic factors that are driving
opportunities within the US Healthcare System.
