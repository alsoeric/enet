Title: Medical Device Product Development Design-for-Usability<br>
Date: 2019 October 2<br>
Time: 5:30 PM - 8:30 PM<br>
Location: Regis College, Fine Arts Center, 235 Wellesley St, Weston, MA<br>
Price: Member/Alliance Partner $35, Nonmember $45, Student (Member) $10,
Student (Nonmember) $15, Regis Alumni $25, Gold Member No Charge
<p>Description: Design-for-usability is a critical aspect of medical device product
development. More than a third of medical device incidents involve a use
error and more than half of all device recalls for design problems involve
the user interface. Because of this, the FDA has made medical device
usability a key topic of concern and has issued guidance. User experience
plays a vital role throughout the development process from early
feasibility to validation to prevent these user errors from occurring.
