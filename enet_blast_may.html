Title: SBIR: America's Seed Fund<br>
Date: 2019 May 2<br>
Time: 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM<br>
Location: Charlton College of Business, 285 Old Westport Rd, North Dartmouth, MA (Parking Lot 14)<br>
Price: SNEEF Member Free, General Attendee $20,
SNEEF Alliance Partner Member $15 (MDG, CCTC, ENET, etc.)
<p>Description: Please join us for our SBIR event where experts from SMI - UMass Dartmouth's
Federal Lobbyist - explains how to navigate the SBIR process. If you have a
company with strong research capabilities, or are an academic researcher
looking to commercialize a discovery, youâ€™ll benefit from learning what the
program is, how to apply and the processes required to comply with grant
reporting. Grant writing requirements for SBIR/STTR can make the process
seem daunting, but, as with other types of fundraising, there are negatives
and positives to this financial resource. Given the validation and
non-dilutive nature of this source, it can be well worth the effort. At the
end of this event, you will be empowered to find the right opportunity for
you and your company, know where to go to get the help you need, and take
the first steps to being a successful grant awardee!
