Description: Join us to determine what events The Venture Forum will provide for Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. The Venture Forum relies on input from its volunteers and attendees to identify, plan and execute programs that draw an interesting audience, educate, and provide networking opportunities.

No prework required – just show up...we'll have coffee and some sugar-based to treats to keep you going for the 2 hrs. The process is pretty straight-forward: we spend 30-45 minutes brainstorming program/event ideas, then everyone votes to determine the topics with the most interest.  Then, the most important step – getting volunteers to plan and execute the program. If someone is really passionate about a topic, that makes that topic more attractive since someone will work to make it happen.

No experience with The Venture Forum is required. If you are available on Saturday March 9, please join us.  Registration isn't required, but will help us determine coffee and treat quantities.<br>

Description: Entrepreneurs are successful with a combination of passion, a solid idea, understanding earlier customers and a great team. The team entrepreneurs create around them takes many forms, it can be symbiotic co-founders, volunteers and a cadre of service providers.

This month we’ve assembled a host of different service providers from accounting, legal, marketing, manufacturing, product design, hardware prototyping and software to expose entrepreneurs to the vast array of talent on the South Coast.

Again this month we’re experimenting with the format of the program so we will be doing a series of mini-talks designed to give entrepreneurs the tips of the waves of each of the disciplines and allow plenty of time for questions and networking with the providers.<br>
