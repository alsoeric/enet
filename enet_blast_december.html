Overall, ~15% of the global population is affected across all age groups, leading to direct and indirect costs of untreated hearing loss totaling $750 billion.

The diverse needs and challenges of the various auditory diseases have been benefiting from advances in implantable devices, drug development and delivery, and regenerative therapies.
