Entrepreneurs are successful with a combination of passion, a solid idea, understanding earlier customers and a great team. The team entrepreneurs create around them takes many forms, it can be symbiotic co-founders, volunteers and a cadre of service providers.

This month we’ve assembled a host of different service providers from accounting, legal, marketing, manufacturing, product design, hardware prototyping and software to expose entrepreneurs to the vast array of talent on the South Coast.

Again this month we’re experimenting with the format of the program so we will be doing a series of mini-talks designed to give entrepreneurs the tips of the waves of each of the disciplines and allow plenty of time for questions and networking with the providers.
