<p>Description: Design-for-usability is a critical aspect of medical device product
development. More than a third of medical device incidents involve a use
error and more than half of all device recalls for design problems involve
the user interface. Because of this, the FDA has made medical device
usability a key topic of concern and has issued guidance. User experience
plays a vital role throughout the development process from early
feasibility to validation to prevent these user errors from occurring.
