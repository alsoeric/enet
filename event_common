Medical Device Product Development Design-for-Usability
:mdg_title
:mdg_description
Design-for-usability is a critical aspect of medical device product
development. More than a third of medical device incidents involve a use
error and more than half of all device recalls for design problems involve
the user interface. Because of this, the FDA has made medical device
usability a key topic of concern and has issued guidance. User experience
plays a vital role throughout the development process from early
feasibility to validation to prevent these user errors from occurring.

:socoeco_description
Piranha Pond, modeled after the popular television show “Shark Tank”, is a
pitch contest for early stage companies.  This year, for the first time, the
best pitch will win over $10,000 in cash and in-kind services.  Entrepreneurs
will pitch for 5 minutes, and a panel of angel investors will determine the
most compelling pitch.  There will also be an audience favorite award. The
ideal company will be technology oriented, beyond the idea stage, have
the potential to be a scale company, and will have raised funds from
friends/family or grants such as SBIR’s or state agencies.
